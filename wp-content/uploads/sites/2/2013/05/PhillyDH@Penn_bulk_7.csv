Ben,Mearns,mearns@udel.edu,PDH2013resetme,Ben,bmearns,author,www.benmearns.com,bmearns,Lead Geospatial Research Consultant,University of Delaware,"I have recently doing a lot of work with folks in Digital Humanities around geospatial visualization (and potentially analysis of their work).  They want to see DH on Maps!  I'm always curious about data visualization and analysis options ... whether explicitly geospatial, or not.  I worked with Omeka (and Neatline) in one recent project.  I have a general background in other technologies, particularly for the web, including wordpress, drupal, php, javascript, python, etc."
