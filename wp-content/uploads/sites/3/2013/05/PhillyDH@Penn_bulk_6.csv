Jen,Rajchel,jrajchel@haverford.edu,PDH2013resetme,Jen,JenRajchel,author,,peasandpoetry,Assistant Director of TriCo DH & Digital Scholarship Curator at Haverford College,Tri-Colleges,"I hope to attend PhillyDH@Penn to connect with Philly DH community and to learn about new projects. I am particularly excited by the session on ""Strategies for Mobile Technologies in Special Collections."" I recently curated a transmedia exhibit for Haverford College's Special Collections titled ""Who Killed Sarah Stout?"" It is a location based game that asks visitors to solve a 17th Century historical murder using our Special Collections holdings and interfacing with the characters through a mobile device. When planning the exhibit, I was able to brainstorm some of this work at THATCamp Philly. The participants were both incredibly generous and generative! I hope to share the lessons I learned creating the exhibit, hear about other projects, and start thinking about my next digital scholarship project."
